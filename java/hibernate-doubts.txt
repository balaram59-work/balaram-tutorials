steps to jdbc query execution
stmt
prepared stmt 
callable stmt 
sql sybtax for psotgres 
buffered reader
input stream reader 
file input stream
Binary Stream
Input Stream 
try with resources
ResultSet
RowSet
are these thread safe ?
DAO classes?
hw to execute insert stmt 
can I connect to multiple DBs in a same session using JDBC ?
can we implement connection pooling?

Configuration -> SessionFactory -> Session Object
what is a relatio in DB ?
does it work only with relational databases ?
can a same app connect to different types of DB in a same session?
hbm2ddl.auto = update --> creates tables automatically 
show_sql=true --> shows the generated queries by hibernate
what is <session-factory> in hibernate.cfg.xml ?
session factory gives us thread safe session...like connection in jdbc
one project can have only one session , why is this ?
can we make a Java User Defined type field to be @Id? -- something like embeddable for non-PK field ?
how does it handle the data conversion between object and table row ?
do we need <mapping> in hibernate config even if we use @Entity annotation on the class ?
can we save without session.beginTransaction?
when we call session.save(object)... does it get stored in DB but not yet commited?
what's the difference between session and transaction
what if primary key in DB is defined by nultiple columns, In such a scenario where do we put @Id in java?
Commonly used annoatations - Entity, Table, Id, GeneratedValue, Column, Transient , Temporal, Lob, Embeddable, OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, JoinColumn, JoinTable
how does GeneratedValuework? does the next value generated by java or do we off load it to SQL?
how does Temporal work 
why does session.get(<Entity>, Serializable id)... say id to be serializable ?
wat is cache in hibernate? where are object in cache store ? in JVM which area?
load -- lazy initialization
load throws ObjectNotFound(run time)... does it throw it even before the reference variable id dereferenced (used ?)
what if object exists in cache but another user via another system/thread has delete the object from DB?...control mechanismlike locking in db ??
learn about generics
investigate more about cache
in embeddable, what if we want only id of embedded object and have a seperate table for embeddable objects?
when multiple apps run on same jvm at sam etime... how does mermory allotment and segregation take place?
in spring, where is the memory allocated for container... can there be multiple containers in a single app ?
in OneToOne, the mapping column can be added in either of the tables ? dependes on direction of raltionship... decided by programmer ??
what happens if we try to save with out using OneToOne annotation on the foreign key?
can we refere a non existent row as FK ?
mappedBy property -- relates to responsibility
JoinColumn..what happens if we dont use this property ?
What iuf the order of saving question and answer jumbles / out of order ?
whats the need for this property if P is used as FK ?
in bi directional relationships, do we need to use JonColumn in both entitites ?
do we need to use JoinColumn in uni directional ?
in OneToMany, the mapping column in present in many side table ?
in ManyToOne, the mapping column is presentin many side table ?
what happens if we dont annotate on both sides in OneToMany, ManyToOne
what can be inferred form above three ? 
constraint in rdbms
directionof mapping tells which entity knows about other... owner of te relationship.. this awareness may differ in java program and in dbms dependingon usage of mappedBy. The table row may not be aware but while fetching data in to java objects, the objectds will be aware...
dont forget to see the sql query generated in oneToMany... when you do a get 
"Using mappedBy can reduce the number of SQL queries fired when saving the child entity. The parent entity is not updated when the child is saved, which can improve performance." how ???
what is n+1th problem?
can mappedBy used in ManyToMany ?
inversejoincolumn, joinColumn, JoinTable
lazy, eager fetch type
Lazy is by default
In eager, data loading happens on the spot 
In lazy the associated data loads when they call getter or setter 
what is JIT compilaton in java ?
In List<Answers>... for lazy loading, how is the proxy created ? is it a proxy of the arrya list  or each proxy created for every array entry ?
How do we evaluate whether we should use eager loading or lzay loading? essentially extra memory or additional DB call ??
Hiberbate states - Transient, Persistent, Detached, Removed 
Session Object -- is the mediatory between java and DB.. it has many methods 
what happens if we save the object but change the attribute value before commit ??
what happens to session object when we close / clear the session ?
Obj obj1 = new Obj()
--in transient state--
session.save(obj1)
--in persistent state---
in this state both db and session object have ref to the object 
session.close() session.clear()
--in detached state--
in htis state object ref is removed form session object
session.del()
--in removed state---
in htis state, oibj is removed form DB but ref is present in session object 
cna Iget all the references in a session object ? session.contains method tells the if an obj ref is there in session or not 
session.save().. saves the object in session but no tin DB and the object gets saved in DB nly iif transaction.commit() ?
HQL -- Hibernate Query Language -- DB independent 
Hibernate supports bith HQL and SQL
=: in HQL for qynamic param... query.setParameter 
JOIN in HQL is not clear... refer it once more .. same for inverse join column, joinColumn in ManyToMany...
setFirstResult... setMaxResult in hibernate 
if we use HQL, we get typecasted result or else Object ??
cascade --- does it ensure even dependent objects are saved in DB ..when we save parent ?
Lets say cascade is enab;led and two parent objects have same dependency... when we try to save the parent objects.. will hibernate save the same dependency multiple times ?
cascade types - All, detach, merge, persist , refresh, remove ...
these cascade types tell you when this cascade type should be applied...apply it during cascade, persist, refresh ...b
how are secrets stored in DB ? IN general where are login creds perissted and how ?
In cache.. what happens if DB entry is chnaged by some other instance ?
In cache -- two levels first, second 
first level -sesion object 
second level - session factory
how are identities managed in session .. how ?
cache.use_second_level , cache.region_factory...
@Cacheble, @Cache(usage = Cache.concuurencystrategy)
If secondary cache is open, then same obj will be returned by multiple sessions
crtieria API -- 
in criteria .. when we add restriction, will the restriction apply in SQL query's where class or will it fetch all entries and then apply filter in jvm ? this can be found out by setting show_sql =true 
"Read only cache was requested by mutable entity"-- note karo
